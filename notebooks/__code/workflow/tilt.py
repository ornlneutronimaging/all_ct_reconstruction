"""
Tilt Correction Utilities for CT Reconstruction Pipeline.

This module provides a placeholder for tilt correction functionality in computed
tomography reconstruction workflows. Tilt correction addresses detector alignment
issues and sample mounting variations that can introduce systematic errors in
reconstructed volumes.

Key Classes:
    - Tilt: Placeholder class for tilt correction operations

Note:
    This module is currently a placeholder and awaits implementation of
    tilt correction algorithms specific to the experimental setup.

Potential Features (for future implementation):
    - Automatic tilt detection from projection data
    - Manual tilt angle specification interface
    - Geometric correction of tilted projections
    - Integration with center of rotation correction

Dependencies:
    - Parent: Base class providing common functionality

Author: CT Reconstruction Pipeline Team
Created: Part of CT reconstruction development workflow
Status: Placeholder - awaiting implementation

    This class serves as a framework for future implementation of tilt
    correction functionality in the CT reconstruction pipeline. Tilt
    correction is important for handling detector misalignment and
    sample mounting variations.
    
    Note:
        Currently contains no implemented methods - serves as placeholder
        for future tilt correction algorithms.
